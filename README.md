# Vanderbilt Digital Humanities Center Blog

This repo is our first attempt at writing/producing a blog for our new DH Center. Feel free to fork but everything here is under the good CC License.

## Workflow

1. Click on upload files.
2. Drag your file and add comments.
3. Commit to master branch.
4. Open new issue and tag your reviewers.
5. Reviewers look at post and provide feedback.
6. Submitter reply to feedback.
7. Rinse and repeat as often as needed.
8. Reviewers once everything is a go, give the thumbsup.

Then your final blog post is live!

## Resources

Ideally, posts should be written in Markdown. This is a very simple set of conventions for plain-text markup which can be learned in a few minutes. *The Programming Historian* offers an [excellent guide](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown), written by Sarah Simpkin.
